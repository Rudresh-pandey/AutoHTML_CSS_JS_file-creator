# AutoHTML_CSS_JS_file-creator
This is a automated python script which will create a HTML , CSS and JS file in your desired directory ,

What it Does:-
  .This script will create a directory (project_name) of your desired name
  .Then it will create 3 files of name index.html , style.css and script.js 
  .These file will consist the normal(basic) code which everyone writes when they create a web project
  .index.html will attach the link:css -> style.css and script:src -> script.js 
  
 
How to get started:-

  . First you have to change the location of the path where you want to create the folder(project):

    Change the path = f"To Your desired location \{filename} " *do not change \{filename} variable
    
    And also change the location in these paths:

  .After changing the location you are ready to run the script :
    run the script through any text_editor (running through command line is not working :\)
      Enter the project name:

  . Your project will be created the location you specified with files- index.html , style.css and script.js
  
  
Problems :-
  . Currently I am facing a problem to run it through the cmd , but it will run through any text_Editor
  . If you know how to fix it you can make a PR .
